Pattern searching is a fundamental problem in computer science that involves finding occurrences of a given pattern within a larger text or string. The goal is to locate all instances of the pattern and determine their positions or count.

The pattern searching problem arises in various scenarios, including text processing, data mining, bioinformatics, and information retrieval. It has applications in tasks such as searching for keywords in documents, finding specific sequences in DNA, identifying patterns in images, and more.

The problem can be formally defined as follows: Given a text of length N and a pattern of length M, the objective is to determine the starting positions or indices in the text where the pattern occurs. These positions are often referred to as matches, occurrences, or occurrences.

There are several approaches and algorithms for pattern searching, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. Here are some commonly used algorithms:

1. Naive Pattern Searching: This is a simple and straightforward algorithm that compares the pattern with all possible substrings of the text, one by one. It has a time complexity of O((N - M + 1) * M).

2. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm: The KMP algorithm is an efficient algorithm that avoids unnecessary comparisons by utilizing information about the pattern itself. It preprocesses the pattern to construct a prefix table, allowing for skipping ahead when a mismatch occurs. It has a time complexity of O(N + M).

3. Boyer-Moore Algorithm: The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses a different strategy by comparing the pattern from right to left. It incorporates heuristics to skip ahead in the text based on the mismatched character's occurrence in the pattern. It has a time complexity of O(N + M) in the best and average cases, with worst-case complexity of O(N * M).

4. Rabin-Karp Algorithm: The Rabin-Karp algorithm utilizes hashing to compare the pattern with substrings of the text. It computes hash values for the pattern and text windows and then compares them. It has a time complexity of O(N + M) on average, with worst-case complexity of O(N * M).

These are just a few examples of pattern searching algorithms. Depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the problem, different algorithms may be more suitable in terms of performance, space complexity, and handling of various edge cases.

Overall, pattern searching is a fundamental problem in computer science that involves locating occurrences of a pattern within a larger text or string. It has diverse applications and is addressed by various algorithms, each with its own strengths and trade-offs.
