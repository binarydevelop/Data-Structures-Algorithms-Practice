All even numbers have their last bit set to 0, whereas in Odd numbers it's 1. 

so why AND operator ?
We use AND because we know all odd numbers have their last bit set to 1 and even number to 0 so AND will give last bit set to 1 if it's odd and 0 if its even. 
Because when we do AND operation on a numbers binary form the last bit will be 1.
