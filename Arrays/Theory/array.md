### Array

What is bitonic point in array?
A Bitonic Point is a point in bitonic sequence before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing. A Bitonic point doesn't exist if array is only decreasing or only increasing.

- Monotonic 
An array is said to be monotonic in nature if it is either continuously increasing or continuously decreasing. Mathematically, An array A is continuously increasing if for all i <= j, A[i] <= A[j].

- Two Pointer technique
Two pointers is really an easy and effective technique that is typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array.
Two-pointer technique is commonly used to solve array problems very efficiently. Whenever an array question deals with finding two numbers in an array that satisfy a certain condition, either directly or indirectly, two-pointer should be the first strategy that comes to mind.
