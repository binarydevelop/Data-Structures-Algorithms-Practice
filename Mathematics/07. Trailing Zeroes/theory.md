To count the number of trailing zeroes in a given number, you need to count the number of factors of 10 in that number. This is because every trailing zero in a number is a result of a factor of 10, and a factor of 10 is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 in a number than factors of 5, you only need to count the number of factors of 5 in a number to determine the number of trailing zeroes.

Here's an example using the number 1250:

Initialize count to 0.
1250 divided by 5 is 250, so add 250 to count.
250 divided by 5 is 50, so add 50 to count.
50 divided by 5 is 10, so add 10 to count.
10 divided by 5 is 2, so add 2 to count.
Since 2 is less than 5, we're done.
The number of trailing zeroes in 1250 is 250 + 50 + 10 + 2 = 312.

The time complexity of the algorithm to count trailing zeroes in a number is O(log n), where n is the given number. This is because in each iteration of the algorithm, we divide the number by 5 and discard the remainder, effectively reducing the number by a factor of 5. The number of iterations required to reduce the number to 1 is logarithmic in the original number, since 5^k = n implies k = log_5(n). Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is proportional to the number of iterations required, which is O(log n).
