## Arithmetic Progression
If we have a series of numbers like 
```
2,4,6,8,10,....

then 
a -- first term = 2
d -- common difference = 2

the first term is 
a + 0d = 2
2nd = a + d = 4
3rd = a + 2d = 6

nth term = a + n-1*d
We know avg = sum
            -------
               n

    Then, sum = avg * n 
Sum of AP = (First Term + Last Term)
            ------------------------  * n
                      2
          =  (a + a + (n-1)d)
             ------------------------  * n
                      2
          =   n  
             --- (2a + (n-1)d) 
              2

```
