A number has exactly 3 divisors if and only if it is a square of a prime number. 

The statement that a number has exactly 3 divisors if and only if it is a square of a prime number is a consequence of the properties of prime numbers and their divisors.

Let's analyze why this is true:

1. A prime number has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 has divisors 1 and 2, 3 has divisors 1 and 3, 5 has divisors 1 and 5, and so on.

2. When we square a prime number (let's call it 'p'), we get 'p^2'. The divisors of 'p^2' are 1, 'p', and 'p^2'. Since 'p' is a prime number, 'p^2' has exactly three divisors.

3. Now, let's consider a non-prime number 'n'. It can be expressed as a product of prime factors. For example, if 'n' is not prime, it can be written as 'n = p1^a * p2^b * ... * pk^z', where 'p1', 'p2', ..., 'pk' are prime numbers, and 'a', 'b', ..., 'z' are positive integers.

4. The total number of divisors of 'n' can be calculated using the exponents 'a', 'b', ..., 'z' as '(a+1) * (b+1) * ... * (z+1)'. For example, if 'n = p1^a * p2^b', then the number of divisors of 'n' is '(a+1) * (b+1)'.

5. For 'n' to have exactly 3 divisors, the expression '(a+1) * (b+1) * ... * (z+1)' must be equal to 3. This means there is only one prime factor in the expression (i.e., 'k = 1'), and its exponent is '1' (i.e., 'z = 1'). Therefore, 'n' can be expressed as 'n = p^1', which is 'n = p'.

6. So, if 'n' has exactly 3 divisors, it must be of the form 'n = p^2', where 'p' is a prime number.

To summarize, a number 'n' has exactly 3 divisors if and only if it is of the form 'n = p^2', where 'p' is a prime number. That's why numbers that are squares of prime numbers have exactly 3 divisors.
