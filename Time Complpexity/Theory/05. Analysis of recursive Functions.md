## Analysis of Recursive Functions

- To find the complexity of recursive functions we first write the recurrence relation and then try to solve them. 
   recursion tree, substitution method, or master theorem.

- Recursion tree method
In recursion tree method we tend to solve recurrence relations which have more than one recursive function.

Master Method is yet to be done.
