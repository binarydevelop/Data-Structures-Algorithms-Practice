## Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the growth rate of algorithms and functions. It provides a way to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms by focusing on their behavior as the input size approaches infinity. The three commonly used asymptotic notations are:

1. Big O notation (O):
   Big O notation represents the upper bound or worst-case scenario of an algorithm's running time. It describes the maximum amount of time an algorithm will take to run as a function of the input size. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), it means the algorithm's running time grows linearly with the input size. Big O notation provides an upper limit on the growth rate but does not necessarily guarantee that the algorithm will always take that much time.

2. Omega notation (Ω):
   Omega notation represents the lower bound or best-case scenario of an algorithm's running time. It describes the minimum amount of time an algorithm will take to run as a function of the input size. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n), it means the algorithm's running time grows at least linearly with the input size. Omega notation provides a lower limit on the growth rate but does not necessarily guarantee that the algorithm will always take that much time.

3. Theta notation (Θ):
   Theta notation represents both the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's running time. It provides a tight bound on the growth rate and describes the algorithm's behavior as the input size increases. If an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(n), it means the algorithm's running time grows linearly with the input size, and there exist constants c1 and c2 such that the running time is bounded above by c1n and bounded below by c2n for large enough values of n.

These asymptotic notations are widely used in algorithm analysis to categorize and compare the efficiency of algorithms. They allow us to focus on the fundamental growth rate of algorithms rather than precise running times, making it easier to reason about their scalability and performance.
