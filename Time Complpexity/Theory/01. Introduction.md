## Time complexity 
The analysis which figures out the efficiency of a program is known as Asymptotic Analysis. 
In this analysis we measure the order of growth of a program in terms of input size. 

Example: 
Program to find the sum of n natural numbers. 

Solution 1: 
```js
function sumOfNaturalNumberUptoN(n){
    return ((n * (n + 1)) / 2)
}
```

Solution 2: 
```js
function sumOfNaturalNumberUptoN(n){
    let sum = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i<= n; i++){
        sum += i;
    }
}
```

For the first solution if we pass `n = 1000` then also it will do the constant work implying it doesn't depend upon `n`.   
But for the second solution it will run the `for` loop n times meaning it depends on number n. 
 
**Time complexity != Time taken**
